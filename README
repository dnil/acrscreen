Some of the main programs have embedded Plain Old Documentation. 
Use e.g. perldoc or the pod2* programs (pod2html, pod2man, pod2txt, ...)
to view these.

The main pipe is called as run_screen.sh, which then calls the
phred/phrap/polyphred tools, including checkpoly.pl which produces
summary statistics from the polyphred output, and
polyphredphd2iupacfasta.pl that makes fasta files from polyphred
annotated phd files.
